            <h2><u>Biography</u></h2>
            <p> I reside in Central PA with my husband and 3 children. I attended College at Bloomsburg University in
                accounting. After having children I wanted a career that was flexible. I have been as a Realtor for over
                7 years.
                I've always had a desire to learn new things. My most recent adventure that I have embarked on is
                enrolling at Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp. Over the next 24
                weeks, I plan to learn and gain the skills necessary to begin a new path. A path that allows me
                numerous avenues to explore , within the coding world, and let my creativity soar. Ultimately, I hope to
                possess the skills to work remotely when my husband retires. His dream is to travel the world by sea.
