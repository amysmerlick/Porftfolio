# _**Introdution**_
***
Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp has assigned us with the task of creating our very our portfolio that can showcase our progress over the next 24 weeks. This porfolio has been quite challenging, as we had to build code from scratch. I used the tools I learned from the first 2 weeks of class and implemented flexboxes. The flexboxes allow for seperation among the sections of the portfolio. I look forward to being able to expand my porfolio and update it as I learn new skills.
